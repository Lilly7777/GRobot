# GRobot
#### GRobot - a robot which walks and collects waste.


### Problems to solve
- Soil pollution
- Pollution of streets and parks
- Reaching waste to recycling sites
- Cleaning every day, not once a year

### How GRobot works
- A Raspberry Pi with a camera streams video to a server and it processes the footage based on AI.
- The server finds a piece of waste in the video and returns commands to the robot where to move.
- The robot moves to the garbage and takes it with the help of a special device to the nearest bucket.
